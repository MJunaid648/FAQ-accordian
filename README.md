# FAQ Accordion

This project is a showcase of my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript DOM manipulation. The web page features a collection of frequently asked questions (FAQs) presented in an accordion style. When a user clicks on a question, a smooth transition occurs, revealing the corresponding answer. Clicking on the question again smoothly hides the answer.

## Live Demo

You can see the live demo of this project at [this link](https://mjunaid648.github.io/FAQ-accordian/).

## Features

- Smooth transitions: The answers to the questions are revealed and hidden with smooth animations, enhancing the user experience.
- Accordion functionality: Only one answer is visible at a time. When a new question is clicked, the previously opened answer closes automatically.
- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript: This project demonstrates my proficiency in these core web development technologies.
